## Mobile App Dev - Android Studio

In this project, I have designed and published a mobile app that can be used to show some products and items. I used different technologies and techniques that I have learned during the course, such as RecyclerView, CardView, ViewModel, Database(local/remote database), and UI design principles. 

User can see a list of categories where they can click to any of them and will direct user to a new window. This will allow user to choose one of the items of selected category and user can read detailed information once they click on the item they chose. 

User can add any categories and items, update and delete them.
